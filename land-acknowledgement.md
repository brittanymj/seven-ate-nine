# Land acknowledgement

We acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

We wish to recognize and acknowledge the Lək̓ʷəŋən speaking peoples (Esquimalt and Songhees Nations), on whose traditional territories, we live, we learn, we play and we work and we also want to take a moment to acknowledge where you are coming from. Feel free to use the Native Land map to locate the lands where you are located.
