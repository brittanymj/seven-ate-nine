# iPad Station  

The Tech Teacher leads a number talk and the students use virtual manipulatives on their iPads to solve the problem. The Tech Teacher will have the virtual manipulative site preloaded with suggestions of manipulatives for students to choose from. After the students have represented their thinking with the virtual manipulatives, the Tech Teacher will ensure they have taken a screenshot. The Tech Teacher will print the screenshot or post it to the student’s digital portfolio so that they can access it when they are in the self-reflection station the next day.  
 
# Week 1: 
Do not do a number talk at the iPad station – instead, give the students a chance to explore the virtual manipulatives. Use the reflection station for exploring physical manipulatives and/or doing traditional number talks until there is work to reflect upon.

## Movement through stations: 

Students do not move between the stations in a circular rotation. The iPad station is grouped with the Paperwork Station while the Self-Reflection Station is grouped with the Game Station. For example, on day 1, the Yellow Group will visit the iPad Station then the Paperwork Station. On day 2, they will visit the   Self-Reflection Station then the Game Station. The Green Group will visit the Paperwork Station then the iPad Station on day 1 and the Game Station then the Self-Reflection Station on Day 2.
