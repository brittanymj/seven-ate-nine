# Paperwork Stationâ€¯ 

Students will work independently at this station on worksheets that connect to the current classroom mathematics content. Teachers can provide options for differentiation based on student needs. An Education Assistant could support this station if available. 

# Game Station 

Students will play a game with their partner that connects to the current classroom mathematics content. It is recommended that the Math Teacher introduces the game on Day 1 before students move to their stations so that all students know the rules and objectives of the game.
