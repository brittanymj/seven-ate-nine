# iPad Station
At the iPad station, the Tech Teacher leads a number talk, and the students use virtual manipulatives on their iPads to solve the problem. The Tech Teacher will have the virtual manipulative site loaded up with suggestions of manipulatives for students to choose from. We recommend the site [Polypad by Amplify](https://polypad.amplify.com/p){:target="_blank"}  over the other free virtual manipulative sites that are available.  After the students have represented their thinking with the virtual manipulatives, the Tech Teacher will ensure they have taken a screenshot. The Tech Teacher will print the screenshot or post it to the studentâ€™s digital portfolio so that they can access it when they are in the self-reflection station the next day.
